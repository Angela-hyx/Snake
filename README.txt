Snake Game

Snake Game is a classical 2D game.
A snake eats fruit to grow. The snake cannot collide with itself, and it cannot hit any obstacles or walls.
A snake can eat a special fruit (a triangle shape) to become obstacle-proof for a while. When the effect expires, another special fruit will appear.

How to control snake:
Use W/A/S/D for up/left/down/right to control the snake.

Enhancement:
Implemented obstacles so that a snake will die if it collides with any obsacles.
Implemented a power-up: after the snake eats the special fruit (a triangle shape), the triangle will disappear, and the snake will not die if hitting obstacles. This effect only lasts 300 cycles. After that, the effect will disappear, and another special fruit will appear, and the snake can eat the new triangle.
